# Overview

With the code supplied in this repository, we intend to analyse the well known spambase dataset from the Hewlett-Packard Labs. The data was obtained in raw format from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Spambase and slightly amended for our purposes. The goal is of course to determine whether a given mail can be classified as spam or not.
